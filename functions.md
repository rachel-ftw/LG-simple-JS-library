#The List

Pulling data from [lodash](https://lodash.com/)

###Less Challenging

- [ ] [_.isArray](https://lodash.com/docs#isArray): Checks if a value is an a array, output is boolean
- [ ] [_.stubArray](https://lodash.com/docs#stubArray):This method returns a new empty array.


###More challenging

- [ ] [_.map](https://lodash.com/docs#map): Creates an array of values by running each element in collection thru iteratee. 
- [ ] [_.sortBy](https://lodash.com/docs#sortBy):Creates an array of elements, sorted in ascending order by the results of running each element in a collection thru each iteratee. This method performs a stable sort, that is, it preserves the original sort order of equal elements. The iteratees are invoked with one argument: (value).
- [ ] [_.filter](https://lodash.com/docs#filter):Iterates over elements of collection, returning an array of all elements predicate returns truthy for. 
- [ ] [_.slice](https://lodash.com/docs#slice):Creates a slice of array from start up to, but not including, end.
- [ ] [_.flow](https://lodash.com/docs#flow):Creates a function that returns the result of invoking the given functions with the this binding of the created function, where each successive invocation is supplied the return value of the previous.
