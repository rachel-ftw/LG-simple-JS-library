# Mean

### Overview

The mean function finds the average of a set of numbers in an array.


### Technical Explanation

The function only takes an array with numerical values. It iterates through the numbers in an array and adds them together and assigns that sum to the meanTotal variable. It then divides meanTotal by the total length of the array.

### Code Examples



```
mean([5,3,7,1])
//4
```
