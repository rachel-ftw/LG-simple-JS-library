### Overview

[Lodash Sum](https://lodash.com/docs#sum)

Sum adds the contents of an array together.

### Technical Explanation

Created a function that takes array as the input.
We set a variable equal to the first incidy of the array, 
then created a for loop to iterate through the array
and on each loop it added to the inital variable.
return the initial variable.

### Code Examples

sum([3,4,5,6])
// 18
```
