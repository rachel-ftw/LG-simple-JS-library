# Sum

### Overview

Sum adds the contents of an array together.

### Technical Explanation

We set a variable equal to the first incidy of the array, 
then created a for loop to iterate through the array
and on each loop it added to the inital variable.

### Code Examples

```
sum([3,4,5,6])
// 18
```
