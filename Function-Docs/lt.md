# lt (less than)

### Overview

lt is a function that checks if the first parameter is less than the second parameter. It only takes numbers.


### Technical Explanation

lt was declared as a constant and it takes two numbers as parameters. Using a less than boolean, it evaluates if the first parameter is less than the second parameter. If it is, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

### Code Examples



```
lt(20, 8)
// false
```
