# Multiply

### Overview
The multiply function takes two numbers and multiplies them.



### Technical Explanation
We declared the function name as multiply and set it to a constant variable, then created a simple function that multiplies the parameters of the function together and returns the product of those two numbers.

In the case that undefined is one of the parameters, undefined is treated as 1.
In the case that null is one of the parameters, undefined is treated as 0.


### Code Examples



```
multiply(7,8);
// 56
```
